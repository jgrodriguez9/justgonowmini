Surrounded by swaying palm trees, white sand and turquoise water, it's a wonderland for those seeking romance as well as families looking for an action packed adventure. Take a plunge at one of three swimming pools or grab a racquet and head to the tennis court for a friendly match. Daredevils can enjoy waterskiing or windsurfing while guests planning to stay low-key can kick back and relax with a margarita at the on-site cocktail lounge. In addition, you'll find shopping, live entertainment and a playground for the kids that are just moments away from your door.",
